    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a delicious recipe for ham and potato soup that a friend gave to me. It is very easy and the great thing about it is that you can add additional ingredients, more ham, potatoes, etc and it still turns out great.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3½ cups peeled and diced potatoes</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>¾ cup diced cooked ham</li>
        <li>3¼ cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the 
            milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
